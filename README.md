- [ ] Malware fundamentals: RATs, stealers, worms, rootkits, fileless malware
- [ ] Safe malware labs: analyze fileless malware in VMs, sandbox simulations

### Projects / Labs
- [ ] Build malware analysis lab with multiple VMs (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- [ ] Capture a malware sample in a sandbox, do behavior analysis, write a report
- [ ] Document “malware profiles” for lab samples (stealer, RAT, worm)

### Portfolio / Resume Prep
- [ ] Start GitHub repo with malware analysis write-ups
- [ ] Begin LinkedIn / Medium profile with summaries of your analysis
- [ ] Document network and VM labs, Pi-hole setup

### Certifications (Optional Early)
- [ ] eJPT (Entry-level penetration testing) if ready
- [ ] Free online malware analysis or Python security courses

### Goal by Stage 1
- [ ] Able to analyze malware safely, explain behavior, write reports
- [ ] Small portfolio of labs and write-ups

## Stage 2 (15 → 16) — Intermediate / Skill Deepening

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] C++ basics & RE: understanding unprotected binaries, memory structures, pointers
- [ ] Reverse engineering tools: deeper Ghidra / IDA skills
- [ ] Fileless malware techniques & persistence mechanisms
- [ ] Advanced Windows internals: kernel vs user-mode, services, drivers
- [ ] Networking deep dive: lateral movement, SMB exploits, network sniffing & analysis
- [ ] Threat intelligence: using Shodan, VirusTotal, threat feeds

### Projects / Labs
- [ ] Reverse-engineer a sample C# or Python malware in lab (document steps)
- [ ] Simulate worm spread in isolated lab network
- [ ] Build small “malware detection scripts” in Python (tiny helpers only)
- [ ] Experiment with Pi as isolated honeypot for benign malware traffic capture

### Portfolio / Resume Prep
- [ ] Write detailed lab reports (behavior, indicators of compromise, network traces)
- [ ] Update LinkedIn / GitHub with projects, Python scripts, analysis reports
- [ ] Blog short malware analysis articles

### Certifications
- [ ] Security+ (CompTIA) or similar foundation cert
- [ ] eJPT or TryHackMe intermediate paths

### Goal by Stage 2
- [ ] Solid RE / malware analysis fundamentals

- [ ] Ready to apply for junior malware / SOC labs / internships by 16–17

---

## Stage 3 (16 → 18) — Professional Readiness / Internships

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] C++ reverse engineering: memory analysis, unprotected binaries
- [ ] Advanced malware analysis: rootkits, kernel persistence, ransomware behavior (labs only)
- [ ] Network defense: IDS/IPS basics, monitoring lateral movement
- [ ] Threat modeling & SOC response techniques
- [ ] Safe lab malware creation simulations (for defense learning only)

### Projects / Labs
- [ ] Full malware analysis reports with VM capture & network traces
- [ ] Python scripts / small tools to detect malware behavior (tiny, safe)
- [ ] Raspberry Pi honeypot simulating network threats
- [ ] Capture & analyze fileless malware in sandbox

### Portfolio / Resume Prep
- [ ] Complete GitHub portfolio of 5–10 detailed labs
- [ ] LinkedIn & Medium articles summarizing key malware lessons
- [ ] Show skills: Python scripting (tiny), RE reports, networking diagrams, analysis charts

### Certifications
- [ ] Security+, eJPT, optional OSCP by 18 if fast-track

### Goal by Stage 3
- [ ] Professional portfolio ready
- [ ] Internship or junior role applications possible

## Stage 4 (18+) — Career Growth / Mid-Level

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] Kernel-level malware analysis (lab only)
- [ ] Memory forensics & advanced RE (IDA, Ghidra, x64dbg)
- [ ] Network exploitation and lateral movement simulations
- [ ] Threat intelligence & SOC escalation
- [ ] Professional report writing & incident response documentation

### Jobs & Pay
- [ ] Junior Malware Analyst / SOC: $60k–$75k AUD
- [ ] Mid-Level Analyst / Threat Research: $80k–$100k AUD
- [ ] Incident Response / Reverse Engineer: $85k–$110k AUD

## Key Notes / Tips
- [ ] Malware Types: Know them conceptually and how to detect/defend — no need to create real malware outside labs
- [ ] AI won’t replace your reasoning: Focus on analysis, RE, and threat reasoning
- [ ] Portfolio > age: Age doesn’t matter — your portfolio is what will get you hired
- [ ] Lab safely: Use VMs, isolated networks, and Pi-based honeypots for testing
- [ ] Australian Jobs: Banks, telcos, government, boutique vendors — target portfolio & applications toward these
- [ ] Pay Outlook: $70k AUD at 18+ is excellent; mid-level roles $100k+, senior/contractor $200k+
