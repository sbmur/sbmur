# Cybersecurity & Malware Analysis Roadmap

---

## Current Position (Age 14)

### Skills & Knowledge
- [x] Python basics: print, input, variables, strings, if/elif/else, loops, triple quotes
- [x] Imports, pip, subprocess usage
- [x] RE / malware: can analyze unprotected C++, C#, Python malware
- [x] Network basics: TCP/UDP/HTTP/FTP, basic ports, Wireshark
- [x] OS knowledge: VMs, isolation, basic Windows internals
- [x] Malware reasoning: persistence, fileless malware, RATs, stealers, worms
- [x] Tools: x64dbg, IDA, Ghidra, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Shodan, VirusTotal
- [x] Labs: Raspberry Pi, isolated networks, Pi-hole

### Strengths
- [x] Strong conceptual malware understanding
- [x] Able to reason about malware behavior and defenses
- [x] Good VM/lab hygiene and safety practices
- [x] Analytical thinking in malware scenarios

### Weaknesses / Gaps
- [ ] Limited C++ reverse engineering / kernel-level RE
- [ ] Limited real-world work experience / internships
- [ ] Portfolio / professional presence not fully built
- [ ] Networking & lateral movement deeper knowledge needed

---

## Stage 1 (Now → 15) — Foundation & Labs

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] Python intermediate: automation, file parsing, simple malware simulators in safe labs
- [ ] C# basics
- [ ] Windows internals: processes, registry, services, UAC
- [ ] Networking: TCP/UDP, ports, basic firewalls, network sniffing
- [ ] Malware fundamentals: RATs, stealers, worms, rootkits, fileless malware
- [ ] Safe malware labs: analyze fileless malware in VMs, sandbox simulations

### Goal by Stage 1
- [ ] Able to analyze malware safely, explain behavior, write reports
- [ ] Small portfolio of labs and write-ups

---

## Stage 2 (15 → 16) — Intermediate / Skill Deepening

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] C++ basics & RE: understanding unprotected binaries, memory structures, pointers
- [ ] Reverse engineering tools: deeper Ghidra / IDA skills
- [ ] Fileless malware techniques & persistence mechanisms
- [ ] Advanced Windows internals: kernel vs user-mode, services, drivers
- [ ] Networking deep dive: lateral movement, SMB exploits, network sniffing & analysis
- [ ] Threat intelligence: using Shodan, VirusTotal, threat feeds

### Goal by Stage 2
- [ ] Solid RE / malware analysis fundamentals
- [ ] Portfolio shows ability to reason through malware & networks
- [ ] Ready to apply for junior malware / SOC labs / internships by 16–17

---

## Stage 3 (16 → 18) — Professional Readiness / Internships

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] C++ reverse engineering: memory analysis, unprotected binaries
- [ ] Advanced malware analysis: rootkits, kernel persistence, ransomware behavior (labs only)
- [ ] Network defense: IDS/IPS basics, monitoring lateral movement
- [ ] Threat modeling & SOC response techniques
- [ ] Safe lab malware creation simulations (for defense learning only)

### Goal by Stage 3
- [ ] Professional portfolio ready
- [ ] Internship or junior role applications possible

---

## Stage 4 (18+) — Career Growth / Mid-Level

### Skills to Focus On
- [ ] Kernel-level malware analysis (lab only)
- [ ] Memory forensics & advanced RE (IDA, Ghidra, x64dbg)
- [ ] Network exploitation and lateral movement simulations
- [ ] Threat intelligence & SOC escalation
- [ ] Professional report writing & incident response documentation

### Jobs & Pay
- [ ] Junior Malware Analyst / SOC: $60k–$75k AUD
- [ ] Mid-Level Analyst / Threat Research: $80k–$100k AUD
- [ ] Incident Response / Reverse Engineer: $85k–$110k AUD
- [ ] Red Team / Pentest Intern / Junior: $60k–$85k AUD

---

## Stage 5 (20–22) — Senior / Specialist Roles

- [ ] Roles: Senior malware analyst, senior SOC, malware researcher, contractor
- [ ] Pay: $110k–$150k+ AUD (specialists $200k+)
- [ ] Skills: Kernel-level RE, advanced network attacks, malware automation, incident response leadership
- [ ] Portfolio: Real-world experience + labs + publications + certifications

---

## Key Notes / Tips
- [ ] Malware Types: Know them conceptually and how to detect/defend — no need to create real malware outside labs
- [ ] AI won’t replace your reasoning: Focus on analysis, RE, and threat reasoning
- [ ] Portfolio > age: Age doesn’t matter — your portfolio is what will get you hired
- [ ] Lab safely: Use VMs, isolated networks, and Pi-based honeypots for testing
- [ ] Australian Jobs: Banks, telcos, government, boutique vendors — target portfolio & applications toward these
- [ ] Pay Outlook: $70k AUD at 18+ is excellent; mid-level roles $100k+, senior/contractor $200k+
